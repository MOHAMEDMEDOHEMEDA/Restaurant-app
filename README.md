In this guided project
You'll design an interactive menu for a restaurant that allows the customer to view a list of offerings,
add items to an order,
and submit the order to the restaurant.
Using a server that you'll run on your own computer,
you'll have an opportunity to modify the options, descriptions, and images that are returned from the API.
